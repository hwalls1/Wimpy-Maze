# Wimpy-Maze
Designd and implemented a GUI based C++ application to randomly construct an n X n maze with a path from a start cell to an end cell. This is a challenging problem that requires implementation of  an adjacency list, "equivalence classes", the "union-find" algorithm, depth-first search of an undirected graph, and some understanding of the GUI programming.
